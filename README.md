# RushHour
Imagine you're driving a car to reach the office and you got stuck at a 4-Way Intersection. You have to move other cars in front of yours to reach the destination but other cars can move only in horizontal or vertical. Try solving it so you can reach the office on time.

RushHour is a sliding puzzle game made with Flutter. It consists of 50 different levels which require 4-50 moves to solve the puzzle.

## ToDo:
1. Implementing level-wise rather than generating random levels.
2. Adding Test.
3. Hosting moves and time taken to solve globally to achieve ranking.
